# Neutron
Neutron is a packet level, harder to bypass Minecraft 1.8 anticheat made for Spigot servers. This repository is made for you to report bugs and bypasses, you can do so by opening an issue.

## What makes Neutron different?
Neutron is a packet based anticheat, meaning it will monitor all sent packets from players. It is also designed to account for players who have high ping.

Neutron is also made to beat other anticheats in terms of pricing. It will be 10 USD when released.

Neutron has max speed data for almost every movement you can do (sprinting, blocking etc.)

However, Neutron is NOT a simulation based anticheat.

## Notes:
This anti-cheat requires ProtocolLib 5.0 to run.

People have have over 10000 ping will be kicked.
