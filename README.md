# Neutron
Neutron is a (almost) fully packet based advanced anti-cheat solution for Minecraft Java Edition.

## Things to know before doing anything
This anti-cheat is made in specific for 1.8.8 Spigot Bukkit Servers, but more server types may be available in the future.

It requires you to have ProtocolLib 5.1.0 or higher installed on your server, check out https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib/ for more information.

## What makes this anti-cheat better than others?

Neutron is a completely open source anti-cheat, and will always be free to modify or download.

Neutron is also packet based, meaning it can detect exploits on the packet level.

Our anti-cheat solution also accounts for players with high ping (in most cases), meaning it won't flag legit players that have high ping.
