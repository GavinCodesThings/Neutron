# Neutron
Neutron is a Minecraft 1.8 anticheat made for Spigot servers.

## How it works
Movement Wise (Speed and Flight): It compares the player's movements to a legit player's movements to determine if they are cheating.

BlockBreak Wise (BedBreaker): It does some raycasting stuff to make sure you are breaking the block you looking at.

BlockBreak Wise (FastBreak): idk yet

BlockPlace Wise (AutoPlace): It checks if a player has placed 2 blocks or more per tick

BlockPlace Wise (FastPlace): idk yet

Exploit Wise: Not determined what exploit checks will be added yet

Packet Wise (BadPackets and InvalidPackets): Checks if the action completed through the sent packets is actually possible.

Scaffold Wise: Not determined what exploit checks will be added yet

## Notes:
This anti-cheat requires ProtocolLib 5.0 to run.
