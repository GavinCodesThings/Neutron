# Neutron
Neutron is an advanced anti-cheat solution for Minecraft Java Edition (1.8.8) Bukkit servers. This repository is made in specific for reporting bypasses and bugs, you can do so by creating an issue.

## Neutron has been made private, you will have to contact me to have it made specifically for your server. My discord is "te1amon". Prices range from $10-$30 USD

## Very cool things we offer
Neutron is almost fully packet based, meaning it monitors every packet going from the player's client to the server.

Neutron also has movement data for most types of movement (walking, sprinting, blocking, swimming, etc.), making it way more difficult to bypass than other anti-cheats. However, this Anticheat does not have prediction checks.

## Things to remember
Neutron requires you to have ProtocolLib in the server's "plugins" folder.

People who do not send transactions within a certain time frame will be kicked.
